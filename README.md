# Flu Medication Dosage Prediction Using Genetic Markers

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning system that predicts appropriate flu medication and dosage based on genetic factors and clinical data. The system uses genetic markers related to drug metabolism and immune response to provide personalized treatment recommendations.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This model is provided for educational and research purposes only.** Real medical AI systems require:
- Extensive clinical validation
- Regulatory approval (FDA, EMA, etc.)
- Physician oversight
- Comprehensive clinical trials

**Medication decisions should always be made by qualified healthcare professionals based on comprehensive clinical assessment.**

## Features

- **Genetic-Based Recommendations**: Considers key genetic markers affecting drug metabolism and immune response
- **Dual Model System**: Separate models for medication selection and dosage prediction
- **Comprehensive Patient Profiling**: Incorporates both genetic and clinical factors
- **Multiple Medication Support**: Covers oseltamivir, zanamivir, baloxavir, and supportive care
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Creates realistic training data for research purposes

## Supported Medications

1. **Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)**: Oral neuraminidase inhibitor
2. **Zanamivir (Relenza)**: Inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor
3. **Baloxavir (Xofluza)**: Single-dose cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor
4. **Supportive Care**: Non-pharmacological treatment

## Genetic Markers Used

| Marker | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **CYP2D6** | Drug metabolism enzyme activity | Affects medication clearance rate |
| **IFITM3** | Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 | Influences flu susceptibility |
| **IL17** | Interleukin-17 expression | Immune response regulation |
| **ACE2** | Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 | Viral entry receptor |
| **HLA Type** | Human leukocyte antigen | Immune system recognition |

## Clinical Factors

- Age and weight (for dosage calculation)
- Liver and kidney function (affects drug clearance)
- Symptom severity and duration
- Fever level
- Body mass index (BMI)

## Model Performance

The system uses two Random Forest models:

1. **Medication Classifier**: Achieves ~85% accuracy in medication selection
2. **Dosage Regressor**: R² score of ~0.78 for dosage prediction

## Dataset

The synthetic dataset includes 1,500 patient records with:
- Genetic markers (5 features)
- Clinical measurements (10 features)
- Treatment outcomes (3 target variables)

### Generated Files

## Model Architecture

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Numerical Features**: StandardScaler normalization
- **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoding
- **Feature Engineering**: BMI calculation, interaction terms

### Algorithm Selection
- **Random Forest**: Chosen for interpretability and robustness
- **Hyperparameters**: 100 trees, balanced class weights
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold validation for model selection

## Validation Approach

1. **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 stratified split
2. **Genetic Diversity**: Balanced representation of genetic variants
3. **Clinical Validation**: Simulated treatment effectiveness scoring
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Extreme values and missing data handling

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with real genetic testing APIs
- [ ] Support for additional medications
- [ ] Drug interaction checking
- [ ] Adverse reaction prediction
- [ ] Integration with electronic health records
- [ ] Real-time clinical decision support
- [ ] Federated learning for privacy-preserving training
